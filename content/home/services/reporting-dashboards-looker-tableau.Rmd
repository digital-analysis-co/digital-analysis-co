We provide you with easy-to-use dashboards that display all of your most important metrics in one place. Ad hoc analysis and business questions often end up as new dashboards.

Our dashboards are customizable, so you can track the metrics that matter most to your business. Report subscription, leadgen or ecom metrics, including subscriptions, trial to paid, purchases, leads and life time value.

We use a variety of powerful tools, including Looker and Data Studio, as well as simple Google Sheets connected to an API or database. We gather, analyze, and present your data in a way that is easy to understand. With our dashboards, you'll be able to quickly identify areas of success and areas for improvement, allowing you to make adjustments and optimize your campaigns for maximum impact.
