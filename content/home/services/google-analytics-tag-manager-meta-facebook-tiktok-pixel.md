Google Analytics is ubiquitous and commonly the source of truth in web, digital and marketing acquisition analytics.

Google Analytics can be used stand alone or to augment your back end data with a rich set of attributes including attribution, device info, landing pages and site engagement data. GA is a tool for analyzing website traffic and user behavior, providing valuable insights for marketing, acquisition, and product analytics. It helps businesses track campaign success, measure ROI, and optimize marketing strategies, as well as identify the most effective acquisition channels and user demographics. By analyzing user behavior on product pages and in the checkout process, businesses can improve their offerings and increase conversion rates. GA is essential for businesses looking to make data-driven decisions and improve their online presence and growth.

It usually makes sense to deploy GA via Google Tag Manager, thereby syncing the tool as much as possible with conversion events in other trackers such as Meta, Adwords or TikTok.

GA works best when it's implemented properly, by a measurement plan along with testing and QA.
