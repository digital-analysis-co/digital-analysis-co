GA4 is ubiquitous and commonly the source of truth in web, digital and marketing acquisition analytics.

GA4 is used to analyze website traffic and user behavior, provide valuable insights for marketing, acquisition, and for product analytics. It helps businesses track campaign success, measure ROI, and optimize marketing strategies, as well as identify the most effective acquisition channels and user demographics. By analyzing user behavior on product pages in the checkout process, businesses can improve their offerings and increase conversion rates. GA4 is essential for businesses looking to make data-driven decisions and improve their online presence and growth.

It usually makes sense to deploy GA via Google-Tag-Manager, thereby syncing the tool as much as possible with conversion events in other trackers such as Meta, Google Ads or TikTok.

GA4 works best when it's implemented properly, by a measurement plan along with testing and QA.
